# Java-Compiler-Execute
This is the Batch file I made to quickly automate the compiling and execution of java files. There are two versions: 
1) JavaC&E-w/path_variable
2) JavaC&E-path_variable

-You will need Java and the Java Development Kit(JDK) in order for this to work.

Download java here: https://www.java.com/en/
Download JDK here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

-If you want to set the path by default, there will be a file in here called: Setup.txt
